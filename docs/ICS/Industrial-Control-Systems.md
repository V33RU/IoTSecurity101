## Overview

Industrial Control Systems—like SCADA, DCS, and PLCs—control everything from electricity generation to water treatment to factory automation. ICS environments:
- Run on legacy tech with safety & uptime as priorities.
- Are rapidly connecting to IT and cloud, exposing new risks.
> **A single breach may mean physical destruction, blackouts, or threats to human life.**

## Current ICS Security Challenges

- **Legacy Devices:** No modern authentication/encryption; many default credentials  
- **Maximum Availability:** Downtime is unacceptable, so patching is hard  
- **Insecure Protocols:** Industrial protocols lack security by design  
- **IT/OT Integration:** Merging IT & OT expands attack surface  
- **Human Factors:** Misconfiguration, lack of training, accidental insider error  
- **Supply Chain Risks:** 3rd-party software/equipment often introduce vulnerabilities  
- **Internet Exposure:** 100,000+ ICS devices found online in 2024 ([Shodan ICS Exposures](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=tags%3Aics))

## ICS Security Best Practices & Standards

- **Segment OT/ICS from IT:** Air gaps, VLANs, strict firewalling  
- **Remove or restrict legacy protocols** (no Telnet/FTP)  
- **No default passwords!** Strong authentication for all ICS assets  
- **Periodic assessment & managed patching** (track vendor advisories)  
- **Asset inventory & network monitoring** — baseline normal, detect anomalies  
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA), VPN for remote**  
- **Physical controls:** Limit physical access to ICS  
- **Incident response plans and backup recovery processes**
- **Security training for all OT/engineering staff**
- **Compliance standards:**

## Recent Research & Conference Insights

- **Geopolitics:** Ukraine war and US-China tensions fueling ICS attacks ([JPCERT 2025](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2025/04/ics-conference2025.html))
- **Manufacturing:** 2/3 of ICS ransomware victims are manufacturing orgs ([Dragos 2024](https://www.dragos.com/knowledge-center/), [Honeywell 2025](https://industrialcyber.co/reports/new-honeywell-2025-cyber-threat-report-reveals-ransomware-surges-46-percent-with-ot-systems-as-key-targets/))
- **Disclosure:** SEC Form 8-K and new [CISA reporting rule](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/directives/binding-operational-directive-22-01/) improving transparency.
- **Malware:** Repurposed older malware now dominates—little truly “new” malware, but attacks are more creative and critical.
